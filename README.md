## üß† What is Marvi?

Marvi revolutionizes how people connect by prioritizing **personality compatibility** over superficial traits. Built on the scientifically-validated Big Five personality model, it creates meaningful matches based on psychological alignment, emotional resonance, and shared values.

Unlike traditional matching systems that focus on demographics or appearance, Marvi answers the question: *"Are we fundamentally compatible as people?"*

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **üî¨ Science-Based Matching**: Uses the Big Five personality model (OCEAN) validated by decades of psychological research
- **üéØ Deep Compatibility Analysis**: Evaluates emotional stability, value alignment, and character resonance  
- **üìä Explainable Results**: Provides clear reasoning behind each match score
- **üîå Easy Integration**: Drop-in solution for existing applications
- **‚ö° Lightweight**: Simple Python implementation with minimal dependencies

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
pip install marvi-matcher
# or clone directly
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/marvi.git
cd marvi
```

### Basic Usage
```python
from marvi.matcher import DatingAppMatcher

# Define user personalities (scores 1-10 for each trait)
user_alice = {
    "openness": 8,        # Creative, curious, open to experience
    "conscientiousness": 6, # Organized, disciplined, goal-oriented  
    "extraversion": 7,    # Social, energetic, assertive
    "agreeableness": 9,   # Cooperative, trusting, empathetic
    "neuroticism": 3      # Emotional stability (lower = more stable)
}

user_bob = {
    "openness": 7,
    "conscientiousness": 5, 
    "extraversion": 8,
    "agreeableness": 8,
    "neuroticism": 4
}

# Calculate compatibility
matcher = DatingAppMatcher()
compatibility = matcher.calculate_match(user_alice, user_bob)

print(f"Compatibility Score: {compatibility:.1f}%")
# Output: Compatibility Score: 87.3%
```

## üß™ How It Works

### 1. Personality Assessment
Users complete a 20-question assessment measuring the Big Five traits:

| Trait | What It Measures | Sample Question |
|-------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Openness** | Creativity, curiosity, openness to new experiences | "I enjoy exploring new ideas and concepts" |
| **Conscientiousness** | Organization, discipline, goal-orientation | "I like to keep my space organized and tidy" |
| **Extraversion** | Social energy, assertiveness, enthusiasm | "I feel energized when around other people" |
| **Agreeableness** | Cooperation, trust, empathy | "I tend to see the best in others" |
| **Neuroticism** | Emotional stability, anxiety levels | "I often worry about things going wrong" |

### 2. Compatibility Calculation
The matching algorithm considers:
- **Trait Complementarity**: Some opposites attract, others don't
- **Value Alignment**: Core beliefs and life approaches  
- **Emotional Stability**: How personalities interact under stress
- **Weighted Scoring**: Different traits have different importance for compatibility

### 3. Explainable Results
Each match includes:
- Overall compatibility percentage
- Breakdown by personality dimension
- Relationship insights and potential challenges
- Communication style recommendations

## üéØ Use Cases

- **Dating Apps**: Find romantically compatible partners
- **Friendship Platforms**: Connect like-minded individuals  
- **Team Building**: Assemble complementary work teams
- **Roommate Matching**: Find compatible living situations
- **Mentorship Programs**: Pair mentors with compatible mentees

## üìà Advanced Features

### Custom Weighting
```python
# Emphasize emotional stability and agreeableness
custom_weights = {
    "openness": 0.15,
    "conscientiousness": 0.20,
    "extraversion": 0.15,
    "agreeableness": 0.30,
    "neuroticism": 0.20
}

matcher = DatingAppMatcher(weights=custom_weights)
```

### Batch Matching
```python
# Find top matches from a pool of candidates
candidates = [user_bob, user_charlie, user_diana]
top_matches = matcher.find_top_matches(user_alice, candidates, limit=3)
```

### Match Explanation
```python
explanation = matcher.explain_match(user_alice, user_bob)
print(explanation.summary)
# "High compatibility due to aligned values and complementary social styles..."
```

## üîß Integration Guide

### For Dating Apps
```python
class YourDatingApp:
    def __init__(self):
        self.matcher = DatingAppMatcher()
    
    def find_matches_for_user(self, user_id):
        user_profile = self.get_user_personality(user_id)
        candidates = self.get_potential_matches(user_id)
        
        matches = []
        for candidate in candidates:
            score = self.matcher.calculate_match(user_profile, candidate.personality)
            if score > 70:  # Minimum compatibility threshold
                matches.append((candidate, score))
        
        return sorted(matches, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
```

### For Team Building
```python
def build_balanced_team(team_members, target_size=4):
    matcher = DatingAppMatcher()
    # Algorithm to create diverse but compatible teams
    # Implementation details...
```
